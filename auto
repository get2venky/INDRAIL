Background
When we think about deterministic automation, the image that comes to mind is a complex system landscape being serviced by virtual bots 
which take over repetitive human tasks like loading data from excel sheets into applications. 
Organizations may spend a good chunk of their IT budget on procuring licenses of RPA and implementing the bots.  
However, this post is not about RPA products. Rather, the focus here is on developing an RPA like tool free of cost. 
Only two things are required for developing such a tool in DIY mode: basic programming background and a bit of imagination. 
Before proceeding further, let me state that I speak from experience, having used open source software to automate some of 
my repetitive tasks as a manager.
